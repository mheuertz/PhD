# To Do

## In waiting

- Amazomics link (number, individuals) *@Niklas*
- Flag link (number, individual) *@Niklas*
- Paracou gaps map of 1992 (both control and treatments) *@Aur√©lie*
- Regional genetic structure in French Guiana (AFLPs) - to decide if sampling will be done in Paracou, all plots, or in Paracou + one or more Guyafor sites *@Caroline*
- Comparison of Structure assignement proportions based on GbS, CROPS, SSRs to identify conflictive assignments *@Myriam"

## Sampling

1. Data on other Guyafor plots than Paracou (Symphonia, environment and genetic)
1. Symphonia characters to note and materials to collect

## Environments

1. Morphotype and Genotype association to environment (Water table, DEM and derivates)(GbS genotypes)
1. Proxy of water table map with DEM

## Genetic

1. Exclude individuals with conflictive gene pool assignment (<-comparison of different genetic marker analyses)

## Functional

1. Functional variability intra vs inter individuals (BRIDGE)

## Morphology
1. "Traits" for morphological character matrix

## Growth

1. Clean Paracou growth data for Symphonia
1. Growth models Go (ontogeny only)
1. Genetic effect on growth
1. Gap effect on Symphonia growth (Treatment, Gap maps, Lidar)

## Others

1. Volunteer/Intern sampling/functional traits
1. Define individuals to sample
1. CEBA/ATT fundings
1. Concept document and scheme

## Questions

*To think of but not always meant to be explored.*

- Flowers ? (collect any flower remainsalong with GPS coordinates, or note nearby individuals, for possible SSR genotyping, so as to enable matching flower size with mother tree (for morpho character matrix)
- Winners and loosers (dbh > 10) ? (Compare "young" vs. "old" cohorts for allele frequency differences: we can assume that selection is strongest at the early life stages, from plant establishment to sapling. Thus, individual with the largest dbh have undergone selection during their establishment at pre-industrial times, whereas the ones with the smallest dbh have undergone recent selection, in the last 30 years or so. This is not strictly winner vs. loosers, but establishment in pre-industrial vs. industrial times, where a climate change effect should already be noticeable).
- Water and/or light ?
- Mortality ?
